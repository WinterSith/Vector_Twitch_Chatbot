# Vector_Twitch_Chatbot
Make Vector respond to Twitch chat commands

1) set up Vector SDK
2) Set up Twitch chatbot according to Twitch's instructions
3) place chatbot code and vector code in same directory
4) run chatbot program.  You will need to know your oauth token and client id

I developed this on a linux machine.  The call to the Vector program may need updated if done on a Windows machine
